# MediaQuery Error Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Description**

The application was throwing a MediaQuery error:

```
dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MediaQuery>() or dependOnInheritedElement() was called before _DashboardScreenState.initState() completed.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The error occurred because:

1. **MediaQuery Access in initState()**: We were calling `MediaQuery.of(context)` in the `_buildHeader()` method
2. **Screen Building in initState()**: The `_buildHomeScreen()` method was called during `initState()` 
3. **Context Unavailability**: MediaQuery context wasn't available until after the widget was fully initialized

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **Before (Problematic Code):**
```dart
class _DashboardScreenState extends State<DashboardScreen> {
  final List<Widget> _screens = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _screens.addAll([
      _buildHomeScreen(),  // ❌ MediaQuery called here
      _buildCoursesScreen(),
      // ... other screens
    ]);
  }
}
```

### **After (Fixed Code):**
```dart
class _DashboardScreenState extends State<DashboardScreen> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // ✅ No MediaQuery calls here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final screens = [
      _buildHomeScreen(),  // ✅ MediaQuery available here
      _buildCoursesScreen(),
      // ... other screens
    ];
    
    return Scaffold(
      body: IndexedStack(index: _selectedIndex, children: screens),
      bottomNavigationBar: _buildBottomNavigationBar(),
    );
  }
}
```

## 📝 **Key Changes**

1. **Removed Static Screen List**: Eliminated the `_screens` list that was built in `initState()`
2. **Dynamic Screen Building**: Moved screen creation to the `build()` method
3. **Context Availability**: Ensured MediaQuery is only accessed when context is fully available

## ✅ **Result**

- **Error Resolved**: No more MediaQuery dependency errors
- **Functionality Maintained**: All responsive design features work correctly
- **Performance**: No impact on performance as screens are still cached by IndexedStack
- **Best Practices**: Following Flutter's recommended patterns for context usage

## 🎯 **Best Practices Applied**

1. **Context Usage**: Only access MediaQuery in `build()` method or later lifecycle methods
2. **Widget Building**: Build widgets that depend on inherited widgets in `build()` method
3. **State Management**: Keep `initState()` for simple state initialization only
4. **Responsive Design**: MediaQuery access is now properly scoped to build context

The fix ensures that all responsive design features work correctly while following Flutter's widget lifecycle best practices.
