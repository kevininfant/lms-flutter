# SCORM Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Flutter Hot Restart Error

The error you're seeing is related to Flutter's debugging system and audio streams, not the SCORM functionality itself.

### Error Analysis:
```
D/AudioStreamTrack(12438): open(), request notificationFrames = -8, frameCount = 0
W/HWUI    (12438): Image decoding logging dropped!
evaluate: (113) Expression compilation error
```

This indicates:
- Audio stream initialization issues
- Flutter hot restart problems
- VM service communication errors

### Solutions:

#### 1. **Clean and Rebuild** (Recommended)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

#### 2. **Restart Flutter Tools**
- Stop the current Flutter session
- Restart your IDE/editor
- Run `flutter run` again

#### 3. **Check SCORM Files**
- Ensure `pri.zip` and `scorm.zip` are in `assets/scorms/` directory
- Verify files are not corrupted
- Check file permissions

#### 4. **Debug Information**
- Use the new Debug Info button (🐛) in the SCORM screen
- Check console logs for specific SCORM errors
- Monitor network connectivity for H5P content

#### 5. **Alternative Testing**
- Try running on a physical device instead of emulator
- Test with different SCORM files
- Verify H5P URLs are accessible
