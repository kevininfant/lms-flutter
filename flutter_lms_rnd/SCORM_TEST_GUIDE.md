# 🧪 SCORM System Test Guide

## ✅ **Errors Fixed & System Ready**

All linting errors have been resolved and the SCORM system is now ready to use with the `pri.zip` file from assets.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. JSON Serialization Methods**
- Added `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to `ScormProgress` model
- Added `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to `ScormInteraction` model
- Removed duplicate extension methods from SCORM service

### **2. Asset File Handling**
- Implemented proper asset extraction using `rootBundle.load()`
- Added support for loading `pri.zip` from `assets/data/` directory
- Created temporary file handling for asset extraction

### **3. Local HTTP Server**
- Implemented proper HTTP server for serving SCORM content
- Added CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Added proper MIME type handling for different file types
- Port auto-detection (8080-8089)

## 🎯 **How to Test the SCORM System**

### **Step 1: Launch the App**
```bash
flutter run
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to SCORM Tab**
1. Open the app
2. Tap the **SCORM** tab in the bottom navigation
3. You should see the SCORM screen with source options

### **Step 3: Load Asset SCORM**
1. Tap **"Local Asset (pri.zip)"** card
2. The system will:
   - Extract `pri.zip` from assets
   - Parse `imsmanifest.xml`
   - Find the entry point
   - Start local HTTP server
   - Load SCORM content in WebView

### **Step 4: Expected Workflow**

- **Parse Errors**: Manages manifest parsing issues
- **Playback Errors**: Handles WebView loading problems
- **Retry Options**: Provides retry functionality

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If SCORM Doesn't Load**
1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages
2. **Verify Asset**: Ensure `pri.zip` exists in `assets/data/`
3. **Check Permissions**: Verify file access permissions
4. **Restart App**: Try restarting the application

### **If Video Doesn't Play**
1. **Check WebView**: Ensure WebView is properly initialized
2. **Verify Server**: Check if local HTTP server is running
3. **Check CORS**: Ensure CORS headers are set correctly
4. **Try Force Play**: Use the force play button if available

### **If Progress Isn't Tracked**
1. **Check JavaScript**: Verify JavaScript injection is working
2. **Check Storage**: Ensure SharedPreferences is accessible
3. **Check BLoC**: Verify BLoC state management is working
4. **Check Console**: Look for interaction tracking messages

## 📊 **Expected Console Output**
